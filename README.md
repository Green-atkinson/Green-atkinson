# Hi, I'm John

Hey, I'm John! I'm a dynamic individual with a passion for both technology and design. I'm a developer looking to merge my interests through intentional design in technology to inspire social change. Having achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, Ron Brown Scholars Captain, and being an MLT fellow, I aim to embody my mantra of identifying a need and making a difference through utilizing my diverse skillset.

I am currently seeking a Remote software developer internship that will combine my skills and interests for Summer 2023. Open to any opportunity.
